# Summary

A brief (one paragraph) explanation of the proposed change.

# Glossary

Terms introduced in this RFC should be defined here.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

# Impact

How will the changes in this RFC affect users, plugin developers, and
interface/platform developers?

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with QIIME 2 to implement. You should expect to include concrete
examples of how the feature is used. Prototyping your ideas before writing this
section is highly encouraged, and can serve as a useful discussion aid during
review. This can be done in a new GitHub repository, in a branch of a fork of
the relevant QIIME 2 repository, or anywhere else that is appropriate for the
RFC. QIIME 2 was built following a [series](https://github.com/biocore/metoo)
of [prototypes](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/q2d2) which were hugely
beneficial to the initial design, and we expect you will benefit from the
process, too.

# How We Teach This

What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this
idea best presented, e.g. as a continuation of existing QIIME 2 patterns, or a
wholly new one?

Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the QIIME 2
documentation/tutorials/workshops must be re-organized or altered? How will
this feature be introduced and taught to QIIME 2 users?

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on: teaching QIIME 2,
the integration of this feature with other existing and planned features, and
the degree of required changes to existing plugins and deployments.

Please identify any potential trade-offs involved with this proposal.

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
to be determined? Questions here can help guide discussion in the initial
review process.
